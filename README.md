# Overgrowth

This is a game created entirely in a 48 hours span as part of [Ludum Dare 42](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/overgrowth) using the Construct 2 engine. The theme was: "Running out of space".

#Play
The game is available to play [here](https://jgaud.itch.io/overgrowth) and includes a comprehensive in-game tutorial on how to play.

#Tools 
The following tools have been used to do the graphics, audio and gameplay which have all been done in 48 hours:
- Construct 2 (Engine)
- Paint.NET (Graphics/Sprites)
- Audactiy (Audio)
- Bfxr (Sound Effects)
- Otomata (Music)

#Strategies
Multiple strategies have been developed by players and myself after the event and are available in the Strategies.txt file found in the repository.
